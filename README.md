This is a new repository that will contain a voxel game-engine, and eventually a game similar to that of Cube World or Trove. 
I already have a private repository in which I created a simulated first-person environment using models. 
However, I want to create something similar using voxels and with my improved knowledge, I think starting from scratch would be best.

This repository will go private once I am far enough in that I think I am making strides towards a game I could publish.
I will expand on this description as time goes on, as I plan to work on this 3 days a week.
